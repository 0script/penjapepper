				<h2>The little history of Penja Pepper</h2>
				<p>
					The whole story of Penja Pepper begins in Cameroon, in the early 1950s, with a banana planter in the Penja region.
					Yes, it was Antoine Decré who decided to plant the first “Piper Nigrum” vines. He cultivated the old fashioned way,
					harvested by hand, bunch by bunch, twice a year.
					
					<br>The first export of pepper took place in 1958, in March to be precise, with a 40 kg bag of pepper.
					But it was in 2013 that the famous Penja pepper obtained its PGI (Protected Geographical Indication),
					one of the first in Sub-Saharan Africa.
					
					<br>The most popular is black pepper which is produced from berries harvested while still green.
					The latter turn black as they dry. Its flavor diminishes over time, especially when the grains are exposed to the open
					air or the sun.
					
					<br>As for white pepper, it is produced from ripe berries that turn bright red when ripe. It is widely used in Chinese,
					Thai and Portuguese cuisine. This gourmet pepper is the first to be affected by the Protected Geographical Indication. White pepper is the primary know-how of Penja pepper farmers.
					
					<br>Green pepper is made from immature berries. It can be used fresh, but unfortunately it does not keep well and therefore
					becomes unavailable in Western cuisine.
					
					<br>As for red pepper, it comes from very ripe berries, just like white pepper. Its grains are preserved in various ways,
					including pickled or dried.
					
					<br>And finally, gray pepper. Most of the time, it's ground black pepper. But it can also be a mixture of black pepper and
					white pepper. This is why it is always sold ground.

					Penja black pepper and its benefits
				</h2>
				<div class="main-section-content">
					<p>
						Most studies carried out on the health benefits of pepper focus on the most used and common: black pepper. 
						These have shown that some of its substances have a positive effect on a large number of disorders or illnesses.
					</p>
					
					<h3>Facilitates digestion</h3>
					<p>
						Black pepper stimulates the taste buds on the tongue, which act on the stomach by increasing the secretion of hydrochloric acid. 
						This is why black pepper can effectively support digestion. Eating it can reduce flatulence and bloating caused by excessive gas digestion.
					</p>
	
					<h3>Stomach pain</h3>
					<p>
						Black pepper is an excellent natural remedy for treating gastrointestinal disorders. Indeed, regular consumption in your dishes can help fight against a certain number of problems such as:
	
							* Stomach pain
							* Abdominal pain
							* Nausea
							* Vomiting
							* Diarrhea
							* Constipation
							* Bloating
							* Flatulence
					
	
						<br>Gastric juices in larger quantities help to reduce these various symptoms.
					</p>
					<h3>Anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antioxidant</h3>
					<p>
						What gives medicinal properties to pepper is nothing other than piperine. Indeed, Aminata Andrieux, naturopath specializing in micronutrition, 
						indicated that “numerous studies have demonstrated that this substance has both anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties”. Known to relieve dental pain or arthritis, piperine is also a good antioxidant.
					</p>
					<h3>Natural antidepressant</h3>
					<p>
						According to a study conducted on mice, piperine, which is a natural component of black pepper, could increase the level of serotonin in the 
						hippocampus and frontal cortex. But also the level of endorphins in the brain, which would help reduce pain and improve mood.
					</p>
					<h3>How to consume Penja pepper?</h3>
					<p>
						<br>The virtues of pepper are numerous, so this spice should not be neglected in cooking. Especially since Penja black pepper offers an incomparable flavor with a pronounced spiciness. You can consume it at each of your meals in a reasonable manner.
	
						However, it is possible to ingest it in other ways, such as in an infusion for example. To do this, boil 25 cl of water and infuse around twenty ground pepper seeds with two cloves of garlic. 
						Add a tablespoon of honey and enjoy. This mixture is also an excellent remedy for sore throats.
	
						<br>The health risks of Penja pepper
	
						<br>As you may have read, pepper has many medicinal properties. However, it also has some disadvantages. For example, high consumption of pepper can cause inflammation in the intestine. In addition, it promotes slow metabolism and is therefore not recommended for people in recovery. It is also not recommended to consume pepper in case of stomach ulcer or hemorrhoids. Just like breastfeeding women and children under 6 years old.
